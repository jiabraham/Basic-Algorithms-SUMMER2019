This program implements Karatsuba's algorithm and multiplies same degree polynomials in O(nlog(3)). The input is formatted in the following way: the first line is the degree of the two polynomials, the second line is the coefficients of the first polynomial, and the third lines is the coefficients of the second polynomial. Karatsuba's algorithm makes use of the fact that additions are cheaper than multiplications, even though in most programs we consider multiplication and addition to both be O(1) operations. This problem was posed by Abhinav Tamaskar on Hackerrank as part of the NYU Basic Algorithms course summer of 2019.
