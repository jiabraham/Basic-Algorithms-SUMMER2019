This program implements the application of depth first search of cycle finding in a graph in O(n+m) complexity. This program takes input in the following form: the first two numbers declare how many nodes exist and how many paths exist(n and m). The following m pairs of numbers come in two columns which describes which nodes are adjacent to each other and have edges between them.
