This program utilizes Kahn's algorithm as an extremely effective manner of implementing topological sort with a min heap(runs in O(n+m) complexity where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges). This program takes input in the following manner: two columns of integers indicating which steps have dependencies and what exactly those depencies are. Topological sort has the most common application when installing computer software. Certain software must have other software in order to be installed, therefore topological sort can be used to figure out what the order of installation must be so that one can have some certain software installed and working correctly. This problem was posed by Abhinav Tamaskar on Hackerrank as part of the NYU Basic Algorithms course summer of 2019.
