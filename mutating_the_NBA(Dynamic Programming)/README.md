The input format of this program is two lines, where sequence a and sequence b are the "DNA" of NBA players. This program makes use of Dynamic Programming algorithm where in you create a table to solve subproblems recursively. The output format is first the highest score of the optimal alignment of the two "DNA" strands(the score is calculated by a +2 for each match of the optimal alignment and a -1 for each mismatch). The next two lines are the optimal alignment that yield the highest score above. This problem was posed by Abhinav Tamaskar the professor of NYU's Basic Algorithms course summer of 2019.
