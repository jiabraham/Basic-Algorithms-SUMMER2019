This project consists of taking in two strings that represent DNA. Then finding the optimal sequence such that is has the highest possible score. Now the scoring matrix adds 2 to the score for a match and -1 for a mismatch. After the optimal string is found, the optimal score is outputted. Then the optimal alignment for each of the two sequences is given.
